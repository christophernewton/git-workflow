	<h1>Regular work flow</h1>
	<p><strong>Request has been made to create a new navigation in the header of the site, this will be a new feature</strong></p>

	<ol>

		<li>Commit work as you go</li>
		<li>Once work is ready to show PM merge into dev</li>
		<li>Once PM has approved merge into staging for client</li>

	<h1>Urgent hotfix</h1>
	<p><strong>Classified as "site down, needs immediate attention to continue to run"</strong></p>
	<p>master > (branch) hotfix/iis-webconfig-update > (merge) master</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/za4ISeN.png">
	
	<ol>
		<li>Create new branch from master called hotfix/iis-webconfig-update</li>
		<li>Solve issue, if it needs testing go to dev, otherwise deploy direct to master</li>
	</ol>

	<h1>Branch naming strategy</h1>

	<p><strong>feature/#ticketnumber</strong>: for new features or code additions</p>
	<p><strong>hotfix/#ticketnumber</strong>: for urgent fixes required for production to continue to work</p>
	<p><strong>chore/#ticketnumber</strong>: deprecation of code, refactoring or package updates</p>

	<h1>Writing good commit messages</h1>
	<p>What usually happens...</p>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RMNYZCN.png" alt="" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">

	<p>#1 rule, give context for the code reviewer. Making a commit message saying "updated css file" gives no context at a high level to people reviewing code. "updated navigation with new hover effect" will allow a reviewer to track down code changes and debug easier.</p>

	<h3>Examples of good commit messages</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>added loading icon for contact and login form</li>
		<li>updated packages in npm to fix security holes</li>
		<li>removed deprecated code from cart api and cleaned up implementation</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Why?</strong> descriptive, outline issue or feature in one sentance, direct</p>
	<h3>Examples of bad commit messages</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>fixed issue</li>
		<li>updated css files and minified js</li>
		<li>dammit i hate ie</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Why?</strong> opinionated, non descriptive, venting, reviewer has no idea what this commit does</p>
